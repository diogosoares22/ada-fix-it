# Introduction

## Abstract

In the 21st century *media coverage* is a crucial factor for political figures. The public is “meant” to believe everything they’re told and not question it, so that people are easily convinced by what they read on newspapers, news websites or social media. Therefore it could be of primarly interest to study and understand *media interest* in different politicians over a specific time period since this interest is capable of influencing the thoughts of billions of people.

## Methods

We could have a rough measure of the above mentioned interest by studying the number of quotes published on newspapers or news websites referred to a given politician on a given period.
In our analysis we will focus on the years 2015-2017 and we will:
* discuss and analyze the evolution of the number of quotes referred to two of the main politicians of the American scene over the past few years: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
* tell the story of the American political scene of these years by comparing it to the evolution of the number of quotes referring to the two politicians; we will identify which factors caused the peaks in the number of quotes or a lack of them.
* compare the media popularity of the two politicians over the years 2015-2017.
* compare our results with Google Trends to see if the conventional media outlets capture the online interest as well.
* try to understand which are the main differences between the speakers whose quotes refer to Trump and the one whose quotes refer to Clinton.
